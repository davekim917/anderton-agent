# Anderton Agent

A personal fleet of AI agents, run from chat. Each agent lives in its own container with its own identity, instructions, tools and secrets. One person runs many of them at once, from Slack or Discord.

The name comes from John Anderton, the man at the wall who sees everything coming in and directs it.

## Status

Early. Anderton Agent is built and used daily by one operator, on one Linux host, and it is published as it is developed. It is not a packaged product yet:

- It is built on [NanoClaw](https://github.com/nanocoai/nanoclaw) and still uses NanoClaw's internal names: the `ncl` CLI, `nanoclaw.sh`, the `nanoclaw-v2-<slug>` service and the `nanoclaw-agent-v2-<slug>` container image.
- It runs on Linux. The setup scripts also carry NanoClaw's macOS path, which is not exercised here.
- Slack and Discord ship in this tree. Other channels install from NanoClaw's own `channels` branch and have not been tested against this code. To fetch that branch, setup adds a git remote named `upstream` pointing at NanoClaw's repository.
- Expect breaking changes. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) records the ones that need an action from you.

| Cross-workgroup reads          | Grants one workgroup read-only access to another's data, by policy on the host.                                                                       | [docs/workgroup-read-access.md](docs/workgroup-read-access.md)   |
| Fleet-wide MCP servers         | Adds an MCP server to every agent with one command, as data rather than code.                                                                         | [docs/fleet-mcp-servers.md](docs/fleet-mcp-servers.md)           |
| Remote MCP over OAuth          | Connects a remote MCP server through its own OAuth flow, with no developer app and no pasted key, and keeps the token fresh.                          | [docs/mcp-oauth-integrations.md](docs/mcp-oauth-integrations.md) |
| Secret intake                  | An agent asks for an API key, and a person enters it in a Slack or Discord form that writes straight to the vault. The key never passes through chat. | [docs/secret-intake.md](docs/secret-intake.md)                   |
| Three providers, with fallback | Claude, Codex and OpenCode providers in the tree. A group can fall back to another provider when its account stops answering.                         | [docs/provider-fallback.md](docs/provider-fallback.md)           |
| Work that survives restarts    | `continue_work` lets an agent promise follow-up that a fresh container must account for after a kill.                                                 | [docs/agent-runner-details.md](docs/agent-runner-details.md)     |
| Keyed task dispatch            | Admits one-shot tasks under idempotent keys, so a repeated event never runs twice.                                                                    | [docs/keyed-task-dispatch.md](docs/keyed-task-dispatch.md)       |
| Slack and Discord in the tree  | Both adapters ship with the code, including hot-attaching a new Slack bot without a restart.                                                          | `src/channels/`                                                  |

## Quick start

Before setup, install two things it does not handle:

- **A C toolchain.** The `better-sqlite3` dependency compiles a native module during install. On Debian or Ubuntu, run `sudo apt-get install -y build-essential`; on macOS, `xcode-select --install`.
- **Docker with BuildKit and Compose, if Docker is already installed.** Setup installs Docker only when it is missing. Ubuntu's `docker.io` package ships without either plugin, so the agent image build fails (`--mount option requires BuildKit`) and so does OneCLI (`Docker Compose is not available`). Either install Docker from [get.docker.com](https://get.docker.com), or add `sudo apt-get install -y docker-buildx docker-compose-v2` on top of `docker.io`.

Clone this repository, then run setup from its root:

```bash
cd anderton-agent
bash nanoclaw.sh
```

`nanoclaw.sh` takes a fresh machine to a named agent you can message. It installs Node, pnpm and Docker if they are missing, registers your Anthropic credential with OneCLI, builds the agent container, and pairs your first channel. Run it from a normal terminal, not from inside a Claude session.
